# Nitrogen-deficiency-classification

The purpose of this project is to help farmer in fertilizer usage. Take a picture of paddy leaf and make nitrogen level classification using web app. So they can use
nitrogen fertilizer wisely.

The web app is local host and I will put a demo below.

All necessary files and pretrained weights are included. I train and evaluate the simple nn model and deploy that model to web app.
Pretrained weights are in deployment/savemodel folder

Here is the demo...
